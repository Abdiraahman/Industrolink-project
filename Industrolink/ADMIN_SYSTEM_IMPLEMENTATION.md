# Admin System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a comprehensive invitation-based admin registration system for the Industrolink project. The system ensures that admin access is completely hidden from regular signup forms and can only be obtained through invitation.

## Features

### 🔐 Invitation-Based Admin Registration
- Admin accounts can only be created through invitations sent by existing admins
- Invitations expire after 24 hours for security
- Each invitation is tracked and logged

### 👥 User Management
- **Student Assignment**: Assign students to specific lecturers
- **Account Approval**: Approve lecturer and supervisor accounts
- **Account Management**: Activate, deactivate, or delete user accounts
- **User Monitoring**: View all users with filtering and search capabilities

### 📊 Admin Dashboard
- Real-time statistics (total students, lecturers, supervisors)
- Pending approval counts
- Recent admin actions log
- Quick action buttons

### 📝 Activity Logging
- All admin actions are logged with timestamps
- Detailed metadata for each action
- Audit trail for compliance and security

### 🛡️ Security Features
- Admin-only access to sensitive endpoints
- Session management and authentication
- Role-based permissions
- Secure invitation tokens

## Backend Implementation

### Models

#### AdminUser
- Extended Django User model with admin-specific fields
- Email-based authentication
- Staff and superuser flags

#### AdminInvite
- Stores invitation details
- Unique tokens for each invitation
- Expiration tracking
- Usage status

#### AdminAction
- Logs all administrative actions
- Tracks target users and metadata
- Timestamp and admin user association

#### AdminSettings
- System configuration storage
- Admin-managed settings
- Change tracking

### API Endpoints

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/admin/login/` - Admin login
- `POST /api/admin/logout/` - Admin logout

#### Invitation System
- `POST /api/admin/invite/` - Create new invitation
- `GET /api/admin/invites/` - List all invitations
- `POST /api/admin/register/{token}/` - Register via invitation

#### User Management
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard/` - Dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/admin/users/` - List users with filters
- `POST /api/admin/users/manage/` - User management operations
- `POST /api/admin/students/assign/` - Assign students to lecturers

#### Monitoring
- `GET /api/admin/actions/` - View admin action logs

### Permissions

The system uses custom permission classes:
- `IsAdminUser`: Ensures only admin users can access admin endpoints
- Regular users cannot see or access admin functionality

## Frontend Implementation

### Components

#### AdminLogin
- Secure login form for admin users
- Email and password authentication
- Error handling and validation

#### AdminDashboard
- Overview of system statistics
- Recent activity feed
- Quick action buttons
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

#### UserManagement
- Comprehensive user listing with filters
- Search functionality
- Pagination support
- User action buttons (activate, deactivate, delete)

#### AdminInvitation
- Send new admin invitations
- View invitation status
- Copy invitation links
- Track invitation usage

#### AdminRegistration
- Registration form for invited users
- Token validation
- Password confirmation
- Form validation

#### AdminLayout
- Responsive sidebar navigation
- User menu with logout
- Mobile-friendly design
- Route protection

### Routing

Admin routes are completely separate from regular application routes:
- `/admin/login` - Admin login
- `/admin/register/{token}` - Admin registration
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard
- `/admin/users` - User management
- `/admin/invitations` - Invitation management
- `/admin/actions` - Activity logs

### State Management

- Uses React hooks for local state
- API service layer for backend communication
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Protected routes with authentication checks

## Security Considerations

### Invitation Security
- Tokens are cryptographically secure (32 bytes)
- 24-hour expiration prevents long-term exposure
- One-time use prevents token reuse
- Email validation ensures proper targeting

### Access Control
- Admin endpoints require authentication
- Staff status verification
- Session management
- CSRF protection

### Data Protection
- All admin actions are logged
- User data access is controlled
- Sensitive operations require confirmation
- Audit trail maintenance

## Usage Instructions

### For System Administrators

   - Filter by role, status, or search terms
   - Approve pending accounts
   - Manage user status (active/inactive)
   - Assign students to lecturers

### For New Admin Users
