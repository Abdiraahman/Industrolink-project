# Student Management Implementation

This document describes the implementation of student management functionality for supervisors and lecturers in the Industrolink system.

## Overview

The system now provides dedicated pages for:
- **Supervisors**: View and manage students under their company
- **Lecturers**: View students assigned to them by supervisors

## Backend Changes

### New Models

#### LecturerStudentAssignment
- Links lecturers to students
- Tracks who assigned the student and when
- Includes notes and active status

### New API Endpoints

#### For Supervisors
- `GET /api/supervisors/students/` - Get students under supervisor's company
- `GET /api/supervisors/lecturer-assignments/` - Get lecturer assignments made by supervisor

#### For Lecturers
- `GET /api/lecturers/students/` - Get students assigned to lecturer
- `GET /api/lecturers/assignments/` - Get student assignment details
- `POST /api/lecturers/assign-student/` - Assign student to lecturer (for supervisors)

### Database Changes

New table: `lecturer_student_assignments`
- `assignment_id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `lecturer` (ForeignKey to Lecturer)
- `student` (ForeignKey to Student)
- `assigned_by` (ForeignKey to Supervisor)
- `assigned_at` (DateTime)
- `is_active` (Boolean)
- `notes` (Text, optional)

## Frontend Changes

### New Pages

#### SupervisorStudents (`/supervisor/students`)
- Displays all students under the supervisor's company
- Shows student information, course, duration, and status
- Provides actions to view, edit, and assign students to lecturers
- Includes summary statistics

#### LecturerStudents (`/lecturer/students`)
- Shows students assigned to the lecturer by supervisors
- Displays student details, company, and assignment information
- Provides actions for evaluation and progress tracking
- Includes summary statistics

### New API Services

#### `supervisorsApi`
- `getCompanyStudents()` - Fetch students under supervisor's company
- `getLecturerAssignments()` - Get lecturer assignments

#### `lecturersApi`
- `getAssignedStudents()` - Fetch students assigned to lecturer
- `getStudentAssignments()` - Get assignment details

### Routing Updates

New routes added to the navigation:
- `/supervisor/students` - Company Students (Supervisor only)
- `/lecturer/students` - Assigned Students (Lecturer only)

## Usage

### For Supervisors
1. Navigate to "Company Students" from the sidebar
2. View all students under your company
3. Use the "Assign to Lecturer" button to assign students to lecturers
4. Monitor student progress and status

### For Lecturers
1. Navigate to "Assigned Students" from the sidebar
2. View students assigned to you by supervisors
3. Evaluate student progress and provide feedback
4. Track assignment details and notes

## Data Flow

1. **Student Registration**: Students register and are associated with a company
2. **Supervisor Assignment**: Supervisors can view all students under their company
3. **Lecturer Assignment**: Supervisors assign students to specific lecturers
4. **Student Management**: Lecturers manage and evaluate assigned students

## Security

- Role-based access control ensures only appropriate users can access each page
- Supervisors can only see students under their company
- Lecturers can only see students assigned to them
- All endpoints require authentication

## Future Enhancements

- Student progress tracking
- Assignment management interface
- Bulk student operations
- Advanced filtering and search
- Student evaluation forms
- Progress reports and analytics
